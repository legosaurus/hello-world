Hi everybody!

My name is legosaurus rex. Am I a lego made out of dinosaurs or a dinosaur made out of lego? In any case, my color is orange with blue accents.

I have a friend name Grumpy. He gets upset whenever he sits on his tail. I always wondered if he is a tiger raised by lemurs or a lemur raised by tigers. Grumpy is best friends with a blue pony named Blossom. They have a pet named Froakie who is also a pokemon. He's blue like Blossom, but he frowns like Grumpy.

Sometimes I wonder if Blossom has a secret identity. Do you think she is Mardias?

Where are you going!?
